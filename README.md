# Unsupervise-learning-project
Customer Segmentation project that using KMeans from the scikit learn library to seperate customer through their purchase behavior then use other data manipulation techniques to check and analyse the characteristic of each segments. Finally I visualize the result with box-plot, bar plot to see the distribution of data for each cluster.
For further info you can check out my project in Jupyter Notebook.
# Libraries used in this project:
- KMeans (data clustering)
- Seaborn, matplotlib (visualiztion)
- Pandas, numpy (data cleaning, maninpulation, analysing data)
